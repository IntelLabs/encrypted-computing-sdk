    added at the end of the queue structure. Modifying the value of an existing
    key will not change the order of the item in the queue structure.

    Read/write access to contained items via their keys is allowed, but removal
    of items occur at the start of the queue structure only. No removals
    are allowed on any other items of the structure.
