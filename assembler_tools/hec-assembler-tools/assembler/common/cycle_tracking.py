class PrioritizedPlaceholder:
    """
    Base class for priority queue items.

    This class provides a framework for items that can be used in a priority queue,
    where each item has a priority that can be dynamically adjusted. Derived classes
    can override the `_get_priority()` method to provide their own logic for determining
    priority, allowing for priorities that change on the fly.

    Priorities are expected to be tuples, and the class supports comparison operations
    based on these priorities.

    Properties:
        priority (tuple): The current priority of the item, calculated as the sum of
            the base priority and the priority delta.
        priority_delta (tuple): The current priority delta.

    Methods:
        _get_priority(): Returns the base priority of the item.
        _get_priority_delta(): Returns the priority delta of the item.
