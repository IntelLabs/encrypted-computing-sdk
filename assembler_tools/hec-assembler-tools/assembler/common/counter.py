"""
Counter module providing sequential value generation with reset capability.

This module implements a Counter class that allows for the creation and management of
counters that generate sequential values. These counters can be individually reset
or collectively reset through the class interface, making them useful for various
numbering and sequence generation tasks in the assembler.

    counters at once.
