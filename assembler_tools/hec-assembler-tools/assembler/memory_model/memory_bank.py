class MemoryBank:
    """
    Base class for memory banks.

    This class simulates a memory bank and its locations, where each address in the memory bank's buffer
    represents a slot with space for a word.

    Constructors:
        MemoryBank(data_capacity_words: int)
            Creates a MemoryBank with a specified capacity in words.

        fromCapacityBytes(data_capacity_bytes: int) -> MemoryBank
            Creates a MemoryBank with a specified capacity in bytes.

    Attributes:
        _current_data_capacity_words (int): Protected attribute representing the current capacity in words.
            This is typically modified when allocating or deallocating spaces in the memory bank buffer.

    Properties:
        CAPACITY (int): Total capacity of the memory bank in bytes.
        CAPACITY_WORDS (int): Total capacity of the memory bank in words.
        buffer (list): The memory bank's buffer, allocated to hold up to CAPACITY_WORDS objects.
            If `buffer[i]` is None, then index `i` (address) is considered an empty/available memory slot.
        currentCapacityWords (int): Current available capacity for the memory bank in words.

    Methods:
        allocateForce(addr: int, obj: object)
            Forces allocation of an existing object at a specific address.

        deallocate(addr: int) -> object
            Frees up the slot at the specified memory address in the memory buffer.
