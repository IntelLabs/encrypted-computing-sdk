    """
    Tokenizes a line of text and extracts any comment present.

    This function processes a line of text, removing line breaks and splitting the line
    into tokens based on commas. It also identifies and extracts comments, which are
    denoted by the pound symbol `#`.

    Args:
        line (str): Line of text to tokenize.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the tokens and the comment. The `tokens` are a tuple of strings,
        and `comment` is a string. The `comment` is an empty string if no comment is found in the line.
