    Encapsulates `kg_start` CInstruction.

    `kg_start` instruction signals the keygen engine to start producing key material
    using the currently loaded seed.

    Rules:
    1. `kg_load`s and `kg_start`s must be `latency` cycles apart from any other
    `kg_load` and `kg_start`. It takes between 10 to `latency` cycles for the key generation
    resource to generate the next key material, possibly causing contention if
    the key material is requested by any `kg_load` within `latency` cycles.
